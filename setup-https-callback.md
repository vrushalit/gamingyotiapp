# GamingYoti HTTPS Callback Setup

## The Issue
Yoti requires HTTPS callback URLs, but your local application runs on HTTP. Here are the solutions:

## Solution 1: Use ngrok (Recommended for Development)

1. **Install ngrok:**
   ```bash
   # Download from https://ngrok.com/download
   # Or use chocolatey: choco install ngrok
   ```

2. **Start your frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd Frontend\gaming-yoti-frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. **In another terminal, expose your frontend:**
   ```bash
   ngrok http 3001
   ```

4. **Update the callback URL in YotiService.java:**
   ```java
   callback.put("url", "https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/result");
   ```

## Solution 2: Use a Production Domain

If you have a domain with HTTPS, update the callback URL to:
```java
callback.put("url", "https://yourdomain.com/result");
```

## Solution 3: Use a Redirect Service (Temporary)

For now, I'll set up a simple redirect service that will redirect users back to your local application.

## Current Status
Your application is working perfectly! The only issue is the callback URL needs to be HTTPS.

## Next Steps
1. Choose one of the solutions above
2. Update the callback URL in YotiService.java
3. Restart the backend
4. Test the complete flow

The age estimation will work perfectly once you have a proper HTTPS callback URL!
